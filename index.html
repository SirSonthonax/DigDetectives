	<h1>Assignment 13/04/2018</h1>
	<p> For my research, I want to use some of the tools shown during class to find out if other authors writing Sherlock Holmes 
		stories mimic the writing style of Arthur Conan Doyle to some extent. Does the computer reveal different results than 
		a regular read through? Do some stories feel like Doyle, even though the computer tells us that the writing style is 
		vastly different? I will do this by comparing the results of running Doyleâ€™s stories through the tools to the results of 
		running fanfiction through the same tools. Possible aspects to focus on could include uncommon words (are certain 
		catchphrases overrepresented in fan works?). </p>
